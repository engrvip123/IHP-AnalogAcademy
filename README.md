## Module 0 – Foundations

This introductory module sets up the essential tools and methodologies for working with the IHP Open PDK in analog IC design. You'll begin by installing and verifying key tools like Xschem and KLayout, guided by the official documentation. Once installed, you’ll explore basic simulations—including DC, transient, AC, Monte Carlo, and S-parameter analyses—through example test cases provided within the PDK.

A modern design flow is introduced, emphasizing the **gm/Id methodology**, which replaces traditional square-law models with a more robust, data-driven approach. The course provides optional tools and scripts to generate and visualize gm/Id lookup tables compatible with the IHP PDK, laying the groundwork for advanced circuit design in later modules.

Whether you're new to IC design or transitioning to an open-source flow, this module ensures your environment is fully prepared for hands-on analog development using the IHP 130nm technology node.




## Module 1 – Bandgap Reference

In this module, you'll begin your first analog design: an all-CMOS bandgap reference. The module is divided into three parts, guiding you from OTA design to full schematic simulation and layout considerations.

---

### 🔧 Part 1 – Designing the OTA

We begin by designing the **operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)** used in the bandgap reference. A Jupyter Notebook with the `gm/Id` procedure is provided to assist in device sizing. While this procedure isn’t covered in depth, it serves as a helpful tool for those interested in data-driven transistor selection.

The focus of this stage is on the **AC performance** of the OTA. You’ll learn how to:

- Create a symbol for the OTA in **Xschem**,
    
- Simulate the design using **Ngspice**,
    
- And analyze the amplifier’s AC performance
    

---

### ⚙️ Part 2 – Building the Bandgap Reference

Next, you'll construct the full **bandgap reference schematic**. Here, you’ll start making practical design choices with eventual fabrication in mind.

This section covers:

- **DC and transient analysis** of the reference voltage,
    
- Considerations for component selection (e.g., resistors, transistor sizing),
    
- Incorporating **mismatch parameters** into your simulation models,
    
- Running your first **Monte Carlo analysis** to assess mismatch effects.
    

---

### 🧱 Part 3 – Layout Introduction

Finally, we introduce the **layout flow** using **KLayout**. A video guide is available to demonstrate the **common-centroid layout** technique for the OTA's input pair.

Although the complete layout of the bandgap reference isn’t covered step-by-step (as it's relatively straightforward), the **final layout is provided** for reference.

> 📌 **Note**: Be sure to consult both the slides and the Markdown file for this module. The slides include additional insights and layout screenshots not shown in the Markdown notes.






## Module 2 – 50 GHz Medium Power Amplifier

Next, we design and simulate some of the **supporting blocks** required for the ADC, such as:

- **Bootstrapped switches**
    
- **Transmission gates**
    
- **Inverters**
    

This part focuses on verifying the **basic functionality** of each block, which are essential building elements in the final system.

---

### 🔁 Part 3 – SAR Logic and Mixed-Signal Integration

With the analog blocks in place, we introduce the **SAR algorithm** and integrate it into a **mixed-signal simulation environment**. This part marks the first hands-on exposure to **co-simulation of analog and digital** behavior.
